### Basics

Hi! I'm Lyza Danger Gardner.

In 2007, three smart people and I formed Cloud Four, we we build, teach and strategize about the mobile Web. I'm a developer, and spend my time split between building things and talking or writing about those things.

### Writing and Speaking

I like to write. My co-founder Jason Grigsby and I wrote [*Head First Mobile Web*](http://hf-mw.com) (O'Reilly) in 2011. I have written shorter things in various places, including [*A List Apart*](http://alistapart.com), [*.Net Magazine*](http://www.netmagazine.com/), [Cloud Four's blog](http://blog.cloudfour.com) and sundry other print and online publications.

I also like to speak. I've spoken at conferences and delivered workshops around the U.S. and in Europe, including [Mobilism](http://mobilism.nl), [Breaking Development](http://bdconf.com), [DConstruct](http://2012.dconstruct.org/), [Neilsen Usability Week](http://www.nngroup.com/), [Web Visions](http://www.webvisionsevent.com/), [Over the Air](http://overtheair.org/blog/), and [PhoneGap Day](http://pgday.phonegap.com/). 

### Things I Do

I have been working on the Web since the mid-1990s, with a mobile and pan-device focus since 2007. The basic things I do include:

* Building web sites
* Making web sites work well on a lot of devices
* Building hybrid native apps (e.g. PhoneGap)
* Making complicated web applications
* Making web sites not suck
* Paying attention and thinking a lot about what's going on with web standards and the future of the web

The "building" piece of this includes what you'd generally expect of a web dev: 

* front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
* back-end languages (PHP, python, ruby)
* web environment components and middleware (MySQL, PostGreSQL, apache)
* tools and workflows (PhoneGap, version control, deployment, SASS, Coffee)
* various ill-defined dev skills (the ability to spell things correctly for the most part, pixel-pushing in PhotoShop, speed with virtual duct tape)
* knowledge of how to figure things out and where to go for information
