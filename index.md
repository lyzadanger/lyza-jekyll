Hi, I'm Lyza Danger Gardner. I'm a person, and this is my web site.

I am a co-founder of [Cloud Four](http://www.cloudfour.com), a Portland, Oregon-based agency that designs, builds and consults about the mobile Web.

I'm a dev. I build, speak, and write about what I do. I travel a lot, and sometimes [take photographs](http://flickr.com/photos/lyza).

I used to have a blog. You can read [archived content here](http://archive.lyza.com).

You can read more [about me](about), or, if you like, [contact me](contact).
